# Fuel Economy Analysis Project
This project explores how vehicle characteristics such as cylinder count, weight, acceleration, and origin relate to fuel economy (MPG). Using a dataset of cars from 1970 to 1982, I analyzed trends in efficiency over time and across regions (USA, Europe, Japan).

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Understand how fuel economy has changed over time
- Investigate how engine characteristics (e.g., cylinders, weight) affect MPG
- Compare fuel efficiency by vehicle origin (USA, Europe, Japan)
- Visualize trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib in Python

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Notable Insights
- 4-cylinder vehicles are consistently the most fuel-efficient across all regions.
- American manufacturers dominate the 8-cylinder category, while 3-cylinder vehicles are exclusive to Japanese makers.
- Despite expectations, 3-cylinder vehicles do not show substantially higher fuel economy compared to 8-cylinder cars.
- European cars surpassed Japanese cars in fuel economy by 1982.

## 📁 Dataset
Use seaborn.load_dataset https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.load_dataset.html to load the mpg (miles per gallon, a measure of fuel economy) data. 

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the notebook `mpg_analysis.ipynb`
3. Run all cells (Python 3.x environment recommended)

## 🔚 Conclusion
This project highlights key patterns in fuel economy and the impact of design choices and regional differences. Future exploration could include modeling MPG prediction or extending the dataset to modern vehicles.
